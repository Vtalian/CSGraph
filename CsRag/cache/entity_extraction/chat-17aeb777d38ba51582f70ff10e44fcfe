R[bl] = 11H。\n（3）指令“mulb % bl\"中指出的操作数为 8 位，故指令的功能为“R[ax]—R[al] X R[bl「‘，因此， 改变内容的寄存器是 AX, 指令执行后 R[ax] =0BF4H, 即十进制数 30600 执  行指令“ imulb%bl ” 后，R[ax]=FAF4H,即十进制数-1292。由此可见，两条指令执行后发 生变化的寄存器都是 AX,但是存入 AX 的内容不一样。mulb 指令执行的是无符号数乘法，而 imulb 执行的是带符号整数乘法，根据 2. 7.5 节中给出的无符号数和带符号整数的乘法运算规 则可知，若乘积只取低 8 位，则两者的机器数一样，在此例中两者都是 F4H； 若乘积取 16 位， 则高 8 位可能不同，此例中一个是 0BH, —个是 FAH。验证：此例中 mulb 指令执行的运算是180 x 17 =3060,而 imulb 指令执行的运算是-76 x 17 = -1292。\n（4）指令“imull $-16 , ( %eax ,%ebx,4) , %eax”的功能是“R[ eax]—( -16) X M[ R[ eax]\n4xR[ebx]]”，其中，第二个乘数所在的存储单元地址为 R[eax]+4 xR[ebx] =0x64 + (0x11 «2)= 0xF8= 000000F8H,因为 M[000000F8H] =000000AOH,与-16 相乘后得到一个负的乘积，因 此乘积的符号为负， 乘积数值部分绝对值的机器数为 000000A0H «4 = 00000A00H,对其各位 取反末位加 1,得到乘积的机器数为 FFFFF600H,即指令执行后 EAX 中存放的内容为 FFFFF600H，其真值为-2560。\n\n2.3按位运算指令\n按位运算指令用来对不同长度的操作数进行按位操作，立即数只能作为源操作数，不能作 为目的操作数，并且最多只能有一个为存储器操作数。按位运算指令主要分为逻辑运算指令和 移位指令。\n2.3.1 逻辑运算指令\n以下 5 类逻辑运算指令中，仅 NOT 指令不影响条件标志位，其他指令执行后，OF = CF =0,而 ZF 和 SF 则根据运算结果来设置：若结果为全 0,则 ZF = 1；若最高位为 1,则 SF = 1。\nNOT：单操作数的取反指令，它将操作数每一位取反，然后把结果送回对应位。\nAND：对双操作数按位逻辑“与”，主要用来实现“掩码”操作。例如，执行指令“andb $Oxf, %aT'后，AL 的高 4 位被屏蔽而变成 0,低 4 位被析取出来。\nOR：对双操作数按位逻辑“或”，常用于使目的操作数的特定位置 1。例如，执行指令“orw$0x3, %bx”\n后，BX 寄存器的最后两位被置 1。\nXOR：对双操作数按位进行逻辑“异或”，常用于判断两个操作数中哪些位不同或用于改 变指定位的值。例如，执行指令“xorw$0xl, %bx”后，BX 寄存器最低位被取反。\nTEST：根据两个操作数相“与”的结果来设置条件标志，常用于需检测某种条件但不能 改变原操作数的场合。例如，可通过执行“testb$Oxl, %al\"指令判断 AL 最后一位是否为 1。 判断规则为：若 ZF=O, 则说明 AL 最后一位为\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model":
