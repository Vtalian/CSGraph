过程中涉及的一些基本问题。为方便起见，本节选择具体语言进行说明，高级语言和机器语言 分别选用 C 语言和 IA-32 指令系统。其他情况下，其基本原理不变。\n3.1过程调用的机器级表示\n程序员可使用参数将过程与其他程序及数据进行分离。调用过程只要传送输入参数给被调 用过程， 最后再由被调用过程返回结果参数给调用过程。引入过程使得每个程序员只需要关注 本模块中函数或过程的编写任务。本书主要介绍 c 语言程序的机器级表示，而 c 语言用函数来 实现过程，因此，本书中的过程和函数是等价的。\n将整个程序分成若干模块后，编译器对每个模块可以分别编译。为了彼此统一，并能配合操 作系统工作，编译的模块代码之间必须遵循一些调用接口约定，这些约定由编译器强制执行，汇 编语言程序员也必须强制按照这些约定执行，包括寄存器的使用、栈帧的建立和参数传递等。\n\n3.1.1.IA-32
