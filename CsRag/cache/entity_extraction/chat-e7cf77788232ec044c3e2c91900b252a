View code:\n```gdb\nl\n```\n2. Set breakpoint at line 5 (movl $0x12345678, %ebp):\n```gdb\nb 5\n```\n\nHere is a screenshot of the GDB environment: <img src=\"作业截图8.png\" width=\"500\">\n\n3. Run the program:\n```gdb\nr\n```\nThe program will stop at the breakpoint.\n\n4. View registers and memory values:\n\nUse `p /x $eax` to view the value of EAX, or use `info registers` to view all register values.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the register values: <img src=\"作业截图9.png\" width=\"500\">\n\n5. Single-step execution:\n\nUse `n` to single-step through the program and view register and memory values.\n\nHere are screenshots of the single-stepped execution: <img src=\"作业截图10.png\" width=\"500\">, <img src=\"作业截图11.png\" width=\"500\">\n\n**Step 5: Complete the table**\n\nFill in the table with the results of the program's execution and the values of the flags register.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the completed table: <img src=\"作业截图12.png\" width=\"500\">\n\n**Step 6: Verify multiplication and division operations**\n\nRun the following code to verify multiplication and division operations:\n```c\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\nvoid main() {\n    unsigned int x = 6;\n    unsigned int y = 10;\n    unsigned int z1 = x * y;\n    unsigned int z2 = x / y;\n\n    int m = 6;\n    int n = -2147483637;\n    int k1 = m * n;\n    int k2 = m / n;\n}\n```\nHand-calculate the values of `x`, `y`, `m`, `n`, `z1`, `z2`, `k1`, and `k2` and compare them with the machine's results.\n\n**Step 7: Write assembly code for multiplication and division operations**\n\nWrite the corresponding assembly code for the multiplication and division operations.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the completed table: <img src=\"作业截图13.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nThat's it!
