% eax, %edx”，其含义为：若 CF = 1,则R[edx]«—R[eax]；否则什么都不做。对应序号 14 的指令\"cmovge （%eax）, %edx\", 其含义为：若 SF= OF 或 ZF = 1,则 R[edx]<-M[R[eax]]:否则什么都不做。\n2.4.5 调用和返回指令\n为便于模块化程序设计，往往把程序中某些具有独立功能的部分编写成独立的程序模块， 称之为子程序。这些子程序可以被主程序调用，并且执行完毕后又返回主程序继续执行原来的 程序。子程序的使用有助于提高程序的可读性，并有利于代码重用，它是程序员进行模块化编 程的重要手段。子程序的使用主要通过过程调用或函数调用实现,为叙述方便起见，本书将过 程（调用）和函数（调用）统称为过程（调用）。为实现这一功能，IA-32 提供了以下两条 指令。\n调用指令\n调用指令 CALL 是一种无条件转移指令，跳转方式与 JMP 指令类似。它具有两个功能： ①将返回地址入栈（相当于 PUSH 操作）；②跳转到指定地址处执行。执行时，首先将当前 EIP 或 CS：EIP 的内容（即返回地址，相当于 CALL 指令下面一条指令的地址）入栈，然后将调 用目标地址（即子程序的首地址）装入 EIP 或 CS:EIP,以将控制转移到被调用的子程序执行。 显然，CALL 指令会修改栈指针 ESP。\nCALL 指令有以下 5 种基本类型。\nCALL NEAR PTR DST：段内直接调用（NEAR PTR 可省略），DST 为子程序入口地址。\nCALL DST：段内间接调用，DST 为寄存器。\nCALL WORD PTR DST：段内间接调用，DST 为存储单元。CALL FAR PTR DST：段间直接调用，DST 为子程序入口地址。CALL DWORD PTR DST；段间间接调用，DST 为存储单元。\n返回指令\n返回指令 RET 也是一种无条件转移指令，通常放在子程序的末尾，使子程序执行后返回 主程序继续执行。该指令执行过程中，返回地址被从栈顶取出（相当于 POP 指令），并送到 EIP 寄存器（段内或段间调用时）和 CS 寄存器（仅段间调用）。显然，RET 指令会修改栈指 针。若 RET 指令带有一个立即数 n, 则当它完成上述操作后，还会执行 R[esp]—R[esp] +□ 操作，从而实现预定的修改栈指针 ESP 的目的。\n\n2.4.6 中断指令\n中断的概念和过程调用有些类似，两者都是将返回地址先压栈，然后转到某个程序去执 行。它们的主要区别是：①过程调用跳转到一个用户事先设定好的子程序，而中断跳转则是 转向系统事先设定好的中断服务程序；②过程调用可以是 NEAR 或 FAR 类型，能直接或间接 跳转，而中断跳转通常是段间间接转移，因为中断处理会从用户态转到内核态执行；③过程 调用只保存返回地址，而中断指令还要使标志寄存器入栈保存。1A-32 提供了以下关于中断的 指令。\nINTn：n 为中断类型号，取值范围为0~255。iret/iretd：中断返回指令，偏移地址和段地址送 CS:EIP,并恢复标志寄存器。\ninto：溢出中断指令，若 OF = 1,产生类型号为 4 的异常，进入相应的异常处理。 \nsys\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the text you provided is a snippet from a technical document or manual related to computer
