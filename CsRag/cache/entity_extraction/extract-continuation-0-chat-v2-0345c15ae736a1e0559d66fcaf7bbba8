方向舍入。就近舍入到偶数。舍入为最近可表示的数，当结果是两个可表示数的非中间值时，实 际上是“0 舍 1 入”方式。当结果正好在两个可表示数中间时，根据“就近舍入”的 原则无法操作。IEEE 754 标准规定：这种情况下结果强迫为偶数。实现过程为：若舍 入后结果的 LSB 为 1 （即奇数）， 则末位加 1;否则舍入后的结果不变。这样，就保证 了结果的 LSB 总是。（即偶数）。使用粘位可以减少运算结果正好在两个可表示数中间的情况。不失一般性，我们 用一个十进制数计算的例子来说明这样做的好处。假设计算 1-24 x 104  + 5.03 x 104  （精度保留两位小数），若只使用保护位和舍入位而不使用粘位，则结果为 1-2400X104 + 0. 0050 x 104 = 1. 2450x 104。这个结果位于两个相邻可表示数 1.24 xlO4 和 1. 25 x 104 的中间，釆用就近舍入到偶数，则结果应该为 1.24x104；若同时使用保护位、舍入位 和粘位，则结果为 1.24000 x104+0.00503 x104=1.24503 x104。这个结果就不在 1.24 X 104 和 1.25x104 的中间，而更接近于 1.25 xlO4,采用就近舍入方式，结果 应该为 1.25x10'。显然，后者更精确。朝+ 8 方向舍入。总是取数轴上右边最近可表示数，也称为正向舍入或朝上舍入。 •朝-8 方向舍入。总是取数轴上左边最近可表示数，也称为负向舍入或朝下舍入。朝 0 方向舍入。直接截取所需位数，丢弃后面所有位，也称为截取、截断或恒舍法。 这种舍入处理最简单。对正数或负数来说，都是取数轴上更靠近原点的那个可表示数, 是一种趋向原点的舍入， 因此，又称为趋向 0 舍入。\n表 3.4 以十进制小数为例给出了若干示例，以说明这 4 种舍入方式，表中假定结果保留 小数点后面三位数，最后两位（加黑的数字）为附加位，需要舍去。\n\n表 3.4 以十进制小数为例对 4 种舍入方式举例\n\n（5）阶码溢出判断\n在进行尾数规格化和尾数舍入时，可能会对结果的阶码执行加、减运算。因此，必须考 虑结果的阶码溢出问题。若结果的阶码为全 1,也即，结果的阶比最大允许值 127 （单精 度）或 1023（双精度）还大， 则发生“阶码上溢”,产生“阶码上溢”异常，也有的机器把 结果置为“+8”（符号位为。时）或“-8”\n（符号位为 1 时），而不产生“溢出”异常。 若结果的阶码为全 0,也即，结果的阶比最小允许值（-126 或- 1022）还小，则发生“阶 码下溢”,此时，一般把结果置为“+0”（符号位为 0 时）或“-0”（符号位为 1 时），也 有的机器引起“阶码下溢”异常。从浮点数加、减运算过程可以看出，浮点数的溢出并不以尾数溢出来判断，尾数溢出可以通过右规操作得到纠正。因此结果是否溢出通过判断阶 是否上溢来确定。\n\n3.4浮点\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text discusses various aspects of floating-point arithmetic, including rounding modes and overflow handling.\n\nHere are the main points:\n\n1. **Rounding Modes**: The text describes four rounding modes:\n\t* +8 (朝+8 方向舍入): Always rounds to the nearest even number.\n\t* -8 (朝-8 方向舍入): Always rounds to the nearest odd number.\n\t* 0 (朝 0 方向舍入): Simply truncates the result, discarding any fractional part.\n\t* Just Near (就近舍入): Rounds to the nearest representable number.\n2. **Overflow Handling**: The text explains how to handle overflow in floating-point arithmetic:\n\t* When the result's exponent is all ones (i.e., it exceeds the maximum allowed value), an \"overflow\" exception occurs.\n\t* When the result's exponent is all zeros (i.e., it is less than the minimum allowed value), a \"underflow\" exception occurs.\n\nThe text also provides examples to illustrate these concepts, using decimal arithmetic for simplicity.\n\nOverall, the text provides a clear and concise overview of floating-point arithmetic, including rounding modes and overflow handling."}]}
