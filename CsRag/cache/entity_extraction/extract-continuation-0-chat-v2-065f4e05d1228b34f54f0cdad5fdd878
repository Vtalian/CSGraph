(问题)到电子工程师使用器件完成基本电路设计的整个转换过程。\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n图 1.10 计算机系统抽象层及其转换\n希望计算机完成或解决的任何一个应用(问题)最开始形成时是用自然语言描述的，但是，计算机硬件只能理解机器语言，而要将一个自然语言描述的应用问题转换为机器语言程序，需要经过多个抽象层的转换。\n首先，将应用问题转化为算法(algo-rithm) 描述，使得应用问题的求解变成流程化的清晰步骤，能\n确保步骤是有限的。任何一个问题可能有多个求解算法,需要进行算法分析以确定哪种算法在时间和空间上能够得到优化。\n其次，将算法转换为用编程语言描述的程序(program),这个转换通常是手工进行的，也 就是说，需要程序员进行程序设计。编程语言(programming language)与自然语言不同，它有 严格的执行顺序，不存在二义性，能够唯一地确定计算机执行指令的顺序。编程语言可以分成 各类不同抽象层的、适用于不同领域的、采用不同描述结构的，等等。目前大约有上千种编程 语言。从抽象层次上来分，可以分成高级语言和低级语言两类。高级语言(high-level language) 和底层计算机结构关联不大，是机器无关语言，大部分编程语言都是高级语言；低级 (low-level language)则和运行程序的计算机的底层结构密切相关，通常称为机器级语言 (machine-level language),机器语言和汇编语言都是机器级语言。机器语言(machine language) 就是用二进制进行编码的机器指令(instruction),每条机器指令都是一个 0/1 序列，因此，机 器语言程序的可读性很差，也不易记忆，给程序员的编写和阅读带来极大的困难。因此，人们引入了一种机器语言的符号表示语言，通过用简短的英文符号和二进制代码建立对应关系，以方便程序员编写和阅读机器语言程序，这种语言被称为汇编语言(assembly language)。因为高级语言的可读性比低级语言可读性好得多，所以，绝大部分程序员使用高级语言编写程序。\n然后，将高级语言程序转换成计算机能够理解的机器语言程序。因为这个转换过程是计算 机自动完成的，因而需要有能够执行自动转换的程序，我们把进行这种转换的软件统称为程序 设计语言处理系统。通常，程序员借助程序设计语言处理系统来开发软件。任何一个语言处理 系统中，都包含一个翻译程序(translator),它能把一种编程语言表示的程序转换为等价的另 一种编程语言程序。被翻译的语言和程序分别称为源语言和源程序，翻译生成的语言和程序分别称为目标语言和貝标程序。翻译程序有以下三类。\n汇编程序(assembler)：也称汇编器,用来将汇编语言源程序翻译成机器语言目标 程序。\n解释程序(interpreter):也称解释器,用来将源程序中的语句按其执行顺序逐条翻译成 机器指令并立即执行。\n编译程序(compiler)：也称编译器,用来将高级语言源程序翻译成汇编语言或机器语 言目标程\n序。\n当然，所有的语言处理系统都必须在操作系统提供的计算机环境中运行，操作系统是对计算机底\n层结构和计算机硬件的一种抽象，这种抽象构成了一台可以让程序员使用的虚拟机 (virtual machine)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you provided a text about computer systems and programming languages, but it doesn't contain the
