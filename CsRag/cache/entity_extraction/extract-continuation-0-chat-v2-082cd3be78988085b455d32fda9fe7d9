所示，计算机中各部件之间通过总线相连，例如，CPU 通过系统总线和存储器总线与主 存相连。在 CPU 和主存之间交换信息时，CPU 通过总线接口部件把地址信息和总线控制信息 分别送到地址线和控制线，CPU 和主存之间交换的数据则通过数据线传输。\n受集成度和功耗等因素的限制，单个芯片的容量不可能很大，所以往往通过存储器芯片扩 展技术， 将多个芯片做在一个内存模块（即内存条）上，然后由多个内存模块以及主板或扩 充板上的 RAM 芯片和ROM 芯片组成一台计算机所需的主存空间，再通过总线、桥接器等和 CPU 相连，如图 6.5 所示。图 6. 5a 是内存条和内存条插槽（slot）示意图，图 6. 5b 是存储摆 制翳（memory controller）,存储器总线、内存条和 DRAM 芯片之间的连接关系示意图。存储控

连接到北桥芯片的总线，也称为处理器总线或前端总线 （Front Side Bus, 简称 FSB）。\n由若干个存储器芯片构成一个存储器时，需要在字方向和位方向上进行扩展。位扩展指用 若干片位数较少的存储器芯片构成给定字长的存储器。例如，用 8 片 4K x 1 位的芯片构成 4Kx8 位的存储器，需在位方向上扩展 8 倍，而字方向上无需扩展。字扩展是容量的扩充,位 数不变。例如，用 16Kx8 位的存储芯片在字方向上扩展 4 倍，构成一个 64Kx8 位的存储器。当 芯片在容量和位数上都不满足存储器要求的情况下，需要对字和位同时扩展。例如，用 16Kx 4 位的存储器芯片在字方向上扩展 4 倍、位方向上扩展 2 倍，可构成一个 64KX8 位的存储器。\n如图 2-3所示，给出了用 8 个 16Mx8 位的 DRAM 芯片扩展构成一个 128MB 内存条的\n示意 图。每片DRAM 芯片中有一个 4096 x4096 x8 位的存储阵列，所以，行地址和列地址各 12 位 （2 口=4096）,有 8 个位平面。\n图 2-3 DRAM 芯片的扩展\n\n内存条通过存储器总线连接到存储控制器，CPU 通过存储控制器对内存条中的 \nDRAM 芯 片进行读写， CPU 要读写的存储单元地址通过总线被送到存储控制器，然后由存储控制器将存 储单元地址转换为 DRAM 芯片的行地址 i
