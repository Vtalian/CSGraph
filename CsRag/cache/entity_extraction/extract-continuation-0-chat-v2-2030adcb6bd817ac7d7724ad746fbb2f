入码”，又称外码。因此汉字的输入码的码元(即组成编码的基本元素)是西文键盘中的某个 按键。\n\n\n5.2.2 字符集与汉字内码\n汉字被输入到计算机内部后，就按照一种称为“内码”的编码形式在系统中进行存储、 查找、传送等处理。对于西文字符，它的内码就是 ASCII 码。\n为了适应计算机处理汉字信息的需要，1981 年我国颁布了《信息交换用汉字编码字符 集•基本集》\n(GB2312—80)。该标准选出 6763 个常用汉字，为每个汉字规定了标准代码，以 供汉字信息在不同计算机系统之间交换使用。这个标准称为国标码,又称国标交换码。\nGB 2312 国标字符集由三部分组成：第一部分是字母、数字和各种符号，包括英文、俄 文、日文平假名与片假名、罗马字母、汉语拼音等共 687 个；第二部分为一级常用汉字，共 3755 个，按汉语拼音排列；第三部分为二级常用汉字，共 3008 个，因为不太常用，所以按偏 旁部首排列。\nGB 2312 国标字符集中为任意一个字符（汉字或其他字符）规定了一个唯一的二进制代 码。码表由\n94 行（十进制编号 0~93 行）、94 列（十进制编号 0~93 列）组成，行号称为区 号，列号称为位号。每一个汉字或符号在码表中都有各自的位置，因此各有一个唯一的位置编 码，该编码用字符所在的区号及位号的二进制代码表示，7 位区号在左，7 位位号在右，共 14 位，这 14 位代码就叫汉字的“区位码”。区位码指出了汉字在码表中的位置。\n汉字的区位码并不是其国标码（即国标交换码）。由于信息传输的原因，每个汉字的区号 和位号必须各自加上 32 （即十六进制的 20H）,这样区号和位号各自加上 32 后的相应的二进制 代码才是它的“国标码”，因此在\"国标码”中区号和位号还是各自占 7 位。在计算机内部， 为了处理与存储的方便，汉字国标码的前后各 7 位分别用一个字节来表示，所以共需 2 个字节 才能表示一个汉字。因为计算机中的中西文信息是混合在一起进行处理的，所以汉字信息如不 予以特别的标识，它与单字节的 ASCII 码就会混淆不清，无法识别。这就是前面给出的第一个 要考虑的因素。为了解决这个问题，采用的方法之一，就是使表示汉字的两个字节的最高位 （b7）总等于 1。这种双字节（16 位）的汉字编码就是其中的一种汉字\n“机内忌”（即汉字内 码）。例如，汉字“大”的区号是 20,位号是 83,因此区位码为 14 53H（OOO1 0100 0101 0011B）,国标码为 34 73H（0011 0100 0111 0011B）,前面的 34H 和字符 “4” 的 ACSU 码相\n同, 后面的 73H 和字符“s”的 ACSII 码相同，将每个字节的最高位各设为 1 后，就得到其机内码 B4 F3H\n（1011 0100 1111 0011B）o 这样就不会和 ASCII 码混淆了。应当注意，汉字的区位码和\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It

The need to represent each Chinese character with a unique code, which is called the \"外码\" or external code.\n2. The concept of \"内码\" or internal code, which is used to store and process Chinese characters within a computer system.\n3. The GB 2312 national standard for Chinese character encoding, which includes three parts: basic characters (687), first-level common characters (3755), and second-level common characters (3008).\n4. The use of a unique binary code for each character in the GB 2312 standard, known as the \"区位码\" or zone-position code.\n5. The conversion of the zone-position code to the national standard code by adding 32 to each zone and position number.\n\nThe text also mentions the concept of \"机内忌\" (internal coding) and provides an example of how to convert a Chinese character's GB 2312 code to its internal code by setting the highest bit of each byte to 1."}]}
