语言的结构体(也称结构)可以将不同类型的数据结合在一个数据结构中。组成结构体 的每个数据称为结构体的成员或字段。\n\n4.3.1.结构体成员在存储空间的存放和访问\n结构体中的数据成员存放在存储器中一段连续的存储区中，指向结构的指针就是其第一个 字节的地址。编译器在处理结构型数据时，根据每个成员的数据类型获得相应的字节偏移量， 然后通过每个成员的字节偏移量来访问结构成员。\n例如，以下是一个关于个人联系信息的结构体：\nstruct cont_1nfo ( char 1d[8]; char name[ 12]; unsigned post；\nchar address[100]; char phone[20]；\n}\n该结构体定义了关于个人联系信息的一个数据类型 struct contjnfo,可以把一个变量*定 义成这个类型，并赋初值，例如，在定义了上述数据类型 struct cont_info 后，可以对变量 x 进 行如下声明。\nstruct cont_1nfo x=(\"0000000\" , \"ZhangS\", 210022,\n\"273 long street, High Building #3015\", \"12345678\");\n与数组一样，分配在栈中的

requires us to analyze a C program, understand its compilation and execution process, and then answer some questions based on that analysis.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given code\nThe given code is a simple C program that defines two functions `addbuf` and `addbuffer`, which both calculate the sum of elements in an array. The program also includes a `main` function to test these two functions.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the compilation process\nThe compilation process involves several steps, including preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking. We are given some commands to compile and run the program using GCC.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the stack frames of addbuf and main functions\nWe need to draw the stack frames of `addbuf` and `main` functions at the point where `addbuf` function executes until the `leave` instruction. Similarly, we need to draw the stack frames of `addbuffer` and `main` functions at the point where `addbuffer` function executes until the `leave` instruction.\n\n## Step 5: Understand the storage of static array buffer\nWe need to understand how the static array `buf` is stored in memory. We can use the `objdump` command to view the contents of the `.data` and `.text` sections of the executable file.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the assembly code generated by GCC\nWe are given some assembly code generated by GCC for the `sum_element` function. We need to understand how this code is generated based on the C code.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the values of M and N\nBased on the assembly code generated for the `sum_element` function, we can determine the values of M and N.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"}]}
