Here are the main points:\n\n1. The first electronic digital computer, ABC, was developed in 1935-1939.\n2. The first practical electronic digital computer, ENIAC, was built in 1946 by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania.\n3. ENIAC used vacuum tubes and could perform calculations at a rate of 5000 additions per second.\n4. The development of ENIAC led to the creation of the first generation of computers, which were based on electronic tubes and had limited storage capacity.\n\nThe text also mentions that there was a controversy over who should be considered the \"father\" of the electronic computer, with some people arguing that it was John Atanasoff, not Mauchly and Eckert."}]}
