1 个时钟周期，缺失损失为 10 ~ 100 个时钟周期，命中率为 90% ~ 99%。\n\n\n图5-5 TLB 和 cache 的访问过程\n\nCPU 访存过程\n在一个具有 cache 和虚拟存储器的系统中，CPU 的一次访存操作可能涉及 TLB、页表、cache、主存和磁盘的访问，其访问过程如图 5-6 所示。\n\n\n\n图 5-6 CPU 访存过程\n\n从图 5-6 可以看出，CPU 访存过程中存在以下三种缺失情况。TLB 缺失(TLB miss):要访问的虚拟页对应的页表项不在 TLB 中。cache 缺失(cache miss):要访问的主存块不在 cache 中。\n缺页(page miss)：要访问的虚拟页不在主存中。表 5-1给岀了三种缺失的几种组合情况。\n表5-1 TLB、page、cache 三种缺失组合\n\n很显然，最好的情况是第 1 种组合，此时，无需访问主存；第 2、3 两种组合，都需要访 问一次主存； 第 4 种组合要访问两次主存；第 5 种组合会发生“缺页”异常，需访问磁盘，并 至少访问主存两次。cache 缺失处理由硬件完成；缺页处理由软件完成，操作系统通过缺页异常处理程序来实 现；而对于 TLB 缺失，则既可以用硬件也可以用软件来处理。用软件方式处理时，操作系统通过专门的 TLB 缺失异常处理程序来实现。\n对于页式虚拟存储器，其页面的起点和终点地址固定。因此，实现简单，开销少。但是, 由于页不是逻辑上独立的实体，因此，对于那些不釆用对齐方式存储的计算机来说，可能会出 现一个数据或一条指令分跨在不同页等问题，使处理、管理、保护和共享等都不方便。釆用下 面介绍的段式虚拟存储器就可避免这种情况的发生。\n\n分段式虚拟存储器\n根据程序的模块化性质，可按程序的逻辑结构划分成多个相对独立的部分，例如，过程、 数据表、数据阵列等。这些相对独立的部分被称为段，它们作为独立的逻辑单位可以被其他程 序段调用，形成段间连接，从而产生规模较大的程序。段通常有段名、段起点、段长等。段务 可用用户名、数据结构名或段号标识，以便于程序的编写、编译器的优化和操作系统的调度管 理等。\n可以把段作为基本信息单位在主存一辅存之间传送和定位。分段方式下，将主存空间按实 际程序中的段来划分，每个段在主存中的位置记录在雙卖中，段的长度可变，所以段表中需有 长度指示，即段长。每个进程有一个段表，每个段在段表中有一个段表项,用来指明对应段在 主存中的位置、段长、访问权限、使用和装入情况等。段表本身也是一个可再定位段，可以存 在外存中，需要时调入主存，但一般驻留在主存中。\n在分段式虚拟存储器中，虚拟地址由段号和段内地址组成。通过段表把虚拟地址转换成主存物理地址，其转换过程如图5-7所示。每个进程的段表在内存的首地址存放在建\n表基址寄存器中,根据虚拟地址中的段号，可找到对应段表项，以检查是否存在以下三种异常情况。缺段（段不存在）：装入位=0。地址越界：偏移量超出最大段长。 访问越\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the provided text is a snippet from a computer science textbook, specifically discussing virtual memory and storage management.
