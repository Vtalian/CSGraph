However, I can guide you through the process and explain what each step entails.\n\n## Step 1: Compile the source files into shared libraries\nThe first step is to compile the source files `14-1-1.c`, `14-1-2.c`, and `14-1-3.c` into shared libraries using the following commands:\n```bash\n$ gcc -shared -fPIC 14-1-1.c -o lib1.so\n$ gcc -shared -fPIC 14-1-2.c -o lib2.so\n$ gcc 14-1-3.c -o 14 ./lib1.so ./lib2.so\n```\nThis will create two shared libraries, `lib1.so` and `lib2.so`, which contain the compiled code for `14-1-1.c` and `14-1-2.c`, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: View the file header of lib1.so\nThe next step is to view the file header of `lib1.so` using the following command:\n```bash\n$ objdump -p lib1.so\n```\nThis will display the contents of the file header, including the magic number, class, data type, version, OS/ABI, ABI version, type, machine, and entry point address.\n\n## Step 3: View the section headers of lib1.so\nThe final step is to view the section headers of `lib1.so` using the following command:\n```bash\n$ objdump -h lib1.so\n```\nThis will display the contents of the section headers, including the name, type, address, offset, size, flags, and link.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the output\nThe output from these commands will provide information about the file header and section headers of `lib1.so`. Specifically, you should look for the following:\n\n* The entry point address in the file header, which indicates where the program starts executing.\n* The virtual address of the `.text` section in the section headers, which contains the compiled code.\n\nThe final answer is: \nThere is no specific numerical answer to this problem. However, by following these steps and analyzing the output, you should gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic linking process and how shared libraries are loaded into memory."}]}
