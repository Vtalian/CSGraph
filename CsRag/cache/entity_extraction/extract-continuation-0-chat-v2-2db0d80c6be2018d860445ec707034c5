盘面上的道密度和位密度示意图。左边采用的是低密度存度方式,所有磁道上的扇区数相同， 所以每个磁道上的位数相同， 因而内道上的位密度比外道位密度高；右边釆用的是高密度存储 方式，每个磁道上的位密度相同，所以外道上的扇区数比内道上扇区数多，因而整个磁盘的容 量比低密度盘高得多。\n\n\n\n存储容量\n存储容量指整个存储器所能存放的二进制信息量，它与磁表面大小和记录密度密切相关。硬盘的未格式化容量是指按道密度和位密度计算出来的容量，它包括了头空、ID 域、CRC 码等信息， 是可利用的所有磁化单元的总数，未格式化容量(或非格式化容量)比格式化后 的实际容量要大。对于低密度存储方式，因为每个磁道的容量相等，所以，其未格式化容量的计算方法为： 磁盘总容量=记录面数 X 理论柱面数 X 内圆周长 X 最内道位密度，由于磁盘每面的有效记录区域是一个环，磁道在这个环内沿径向分布，所以柱面数的理论 公式为： 柱面数=(有效记录区外径-有效记录区内径)：2x 道密度。此外，对于每个磁道具有同样多信息的磁盘，其内圆磁道的记录密度最大，一个磁道能记 录的二进制信息位的理论值应等于“内圆周长 x 最内道位密度”。格式化后的实际容量只包含数据区。通常，记录面数约为盘片数的两倍。假定按每个扇区 512 字节算，则磁盘实际数据容量(也称格式化容量)的计算公式为：磁盘实际数据容量=2 x 盘片数 x 磁道数/面 x 扇区数/磁道X512B/扇区近 30 年来扇区大小一直是 512 字节，但最近几年正在逐步更换到更大、更高效的4096 字节扇区，通常称为 4KB 扇区。国际硬盘设备与材料协会(IDEMA)将之称为高级格式化。\n数据传输速率\n数据传输速率(data transfer rate)是指磁表面存储器完成磁头定位和旋转等待以后，单位 时间内从存储介质上读出或写入的二进制信息量。为区别于外部数据传输率，通常称之为内部 传输速度(internal transfer rate),也称为持续传输速度(sustained transfer rate) 。而外部传输速度 率(external transfer rate)是指主机中的外设控制接口从(向)外存储器的缓存读出(写入) 数据的速度， 由外设采用的接口类型决定。通常称外部传输速率为突发数据传输速率(burst data transfer rate)或接口传输速率。\n由于磁盘在同一时刻只有一个磁头进行读写，所以内部数据传输速率等于单位时间内磁头 划过的磁道弧长乘以位密度。即内部数据传输速率=每分钟转速+60 x 内圆周长 x 最内道位密度\n平均存取时间\n磁盘响应读写请求的过程如下：首先将读写请求在队列中排队，出队列后由磁盘控\n制器解析请求命令，然后进行寻道、旋转等待和读写数据三个过程。因此，总响应时间的\n计算公式为：\n响应时间=排队延迟+控制器时间+寻道时间+旋转等待时间+数据传输时间\n磁盘上的信息以扇区为单位\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role":
