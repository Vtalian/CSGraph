while 结构相似程度由近到远的顺序来介绍三种循环语句的机器 级表示。\ndo  ~  while循环的机器级表示C 语言中的 do ~ while 语句形式如下。\n\n该循环结构的执行过程可以用以下更接近于机器级语言的低级行为描述结构来描述。\n\n上述结构对应的机器级代码中，loop_body_statement 用一个指令序列来完成，然后用一个 指令序列实现对 cond_expr 的计算，并将计算或比较的结果记录在标志寄存器中，然后用一条 条件转移指令来实现“if(c) goto loop；\"的功能。\n\nwhile循环的机器级表示C 语言中的 while 语句形式如下。\n\n该循环结构的执行过程可以用以下更接近于机器级语言的低级行为描述结构来描述。\n\n从上述结构可看出，与 do-while 循环结构相比，while 循环仅在开头多了一段计算条件 表达式的值并根据条件选择是否跳出循环体执行的指令序列，其余地方与 do -
