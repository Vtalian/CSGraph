cache。\n\n组相联映射\n前面介绍了全相联映射和直接映射，它们的优缺点正好相反，两者结合可以取长补短。将 两种方式结合起来产生组相联映射方式。组相联映射的主要思想是，将 cache 分成大小相等的组，每个主存块被映射到 cache 固定 组中的任意一行，也即组相联采用组间模映射、组内全映射的方式。映射关系如下：\ncache 组号=主存块号 mod cache 组数\n若 cache 共 16 行，分成 8 组，则每组有 2 行，此时，主存第 100 块应映射到 cache 第 4 组 的\n任意一行中，因为 100 mod 8 =4。组相联方式下，主存地址被划分为标记、cache 组号和块内地址三个字段。\n\n\n假定 cache 共有 2c 行，被分成 2〃组，则每组有 2c/2q=2c-q 行。设 s=c-q,则 cache 映射方 式称为 2,路组相联映射，即 s = l 为 2 路组相联；s=2 为 4 路组相联，以此类推。若主存共有 2m 块，主存块大小占 2b 字节，按字节编址，则块内地址有 6 位，cache 组号有 g 位，标记和 cache 组号共 m 位，因而标记占 t=m- q 位。\n$的选取决定了块冲突的概率和相联比较的复杂性。s 越大，则 cache 发生块冲突的概率越 低，相联比较电路越复杂。选取适当的 s,可使组相联映射的成本比全相联的低得多，而性能 上仍可接近全相联方式。早几年，由于 cache 容量不大，所以通常 s = l 或 2,即 2 路或 4 路组 相联较常用，但随着技术的发展，cache 容量不断增加，s 的值有增大的趋势，目前有许多处理 器的 cache 采用 8 路或 16 路组相联方式。\n图 6. 22 所示的是采用 2 路组相联映射的 cache,其中每个 cache 行都有对应的有效位 V、 标记 Tag 和数据 Data。整个访存过程为：①根据主存地址中的 cache 组号找到对应组；②将主 存地址中的标记与对应组中每个行的标记 Tag 进行比较；③将比较结果和有效位 V 相“与”； ④若有一路比较相等并有效位为 1,则输出“Hit”（命中）为 1,并选中这一路 cache 行中的 主存块；⑤在“Hit”为 1 的情况下，根据主存地址中的块内地址从选中的一块内取出对应单 元的信息，若“Hit”不为 1,则 CPU 要到主存去读一块信息到 cache 行中。\n图4-7 组相联映射方式的硬件实现\n\n例子：假定主存按字编址，与 cache 之间采用 2 路组相联映射，块大小为 512 字。cache \n数据区容量为 8K 字，主存地址空间为 1M 字。问：主存地址如何划分？要求用图表示主存块 和 cache 行之间的映射关系，并说明 CPU 对主存单元 01202H 的访问过程。\ncache 数据容量为 8K 字=213 字=23 组 X21 行/组 x512 字/行。主存地址空间为 1M 字=220 字=211 块 X512字/块=28 组群 x23 块/组群 x29 字/块。\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you provided a text in Chinese about computer memory and cache mapping. I'll try to summarize the key points:\n\n**Cache Mapping**\n\nThe text discusses different types of cache mapping, including direct mapping, fully associative mapping, and set-associative mapping.\n\n* Direct mapping is simple but has high conflict rates.\n* Fully associative mapping has low conflict rates but is complex and power-hungry.\n* Set-associative mapping combines the benefits of both, with a compromise on complexity and performance.\n\n**Set-Associative Mapping**\n\nThe text explains that set-associative mapping divides the cache into equal-sized sets, each containing multiple lines. The main memory block is mapped to any line within its corresponding set. The mapping formula is:\n\ncache set number = main memory block number mod cache set number\n\nFor example, if the cache has 16 rows and is divided into 8 sets, each set contains 2 rows. The main memory block #100 would be mapped to any row in set #4 (since 100 mod 8 = 4).\n\n**Example**\n\nThe text provides an example where the main memory address space is 1M bytes, with a block size of 512 bytes. The cache data capacity is 8K bytes, which means it has 23 sets x 21 rows/set x 512 bytes/row.\n\nThe main memory address is divided into three parts: tag, cache set number, and block offset. The tag occupies t = m - q bits (where m is the total number of main memory blocks and q is the number of cache sets), while the cache set number occupies g bits.\n\nThe text concludes that the choice of s (the number of ways in a set-associative mapping) affects both conflict rates and complexity. A larger s reduces conflict rates but increases complexity.\n\nI hope this summary helps!"}]}
