不能太大，也不能太小。\n除了上述提到的这些因素外，设计 cache 时还要考虑以下因素：釆用单级还是多级 cache、数据 cache 和指令 cache 是分开还是合在一起、主存一总线一 cache—CPU 之间釆用什么架构等， 甚至主存 DRAM 芯片的内部结构、存储器总线的总线事务类型等，也都与 cache 设计有关，都 会影响系统总体性能。下面对这些问题进行简单分析说明。\n\n单级/多级 cache,联合/分离 cache 的选择问题\n\n早期釆用的是单级片外 cache,近年来，多级片内 cache 系统已成为主流。目前 cache 基本 上都在CPU 芯片内，且使用 L1 和 L2 cache,甚至有 L3 cache, CPU 的访问顺序为 LI cache、12 cache 和 L3 cache。通常 LI cache 釆用分离 cache,即数据 cache 和指令 cache 分开设置,分别 存放数据和指令。指令 cache 有时称为代码 cache (code cache)。L2 cache 和 L3 cache 为联合 cache,即数据和指令放在一个 cache 中。\n由于多级 cache 中各级 cache 所处的位置不同，使得对它们的设计目标有所不同。例如， 假定是两级 cache。那么，对于 LI cache,通常更关注速度而不要求有很高的命中率，因为，即 使不命中，还可以到 L2 cache 中访问，12 cache 的速度比主存速度快得多；而对于 L2 cache, 则要求尽量提高其命中率， 因为若不命中，则必须到慢速的主存中访问，其缺失损失会很大而 影响总体性能。\n\n主存一总线-cache 间的连接结构问题\n\n在主存和 cache 之间传输的单位是主存块，要使缺失损失最小，必须在主存、总线和 cache 之间构建快速的传输通道。什么样的连接结构才能使主存块在主存和 cache 之间的传输速度最 快呢？\n为了计算将主存块传送到 cache 所用的时间，必须先了解 CPU 从主存取一块信息到 cache 的过程。从主存读一块数据到 cache, 一般包含以下三个阶段。\n・发送地址和读命令到主存：假定用 1 个时钟周期；\n主存准备好一个数据：假定用 10 个时钟周期；\n・从总线传送一个数据：假定用 1 个时钟周期。\n主存、总线和 cache 之间可以有三种连接方式：①窄型结构，即在主存、总线和 cache 之 间每次按一个字的宽度进行传送；②宽型结构，即在它们之间每次传送多个字；③交叉存储 结构，即主存釆用多模块交叉存取方式，在主存、总线和 cache 之间每次按一个字的宽度进行 传送。假定一个主存块有 4 个字，那么对于这三种结构，其缺失损失各是多少呢？\n图 4-9给出了三种方式下的主存块传送过程。图 6. 24a 对应于窄型结构，连续进行\n“送 地址一读出一传送” 4 次，每次一个字，其缺失损失为 4x(1 +10 + 1) =48 个时钟周期。 图 6. 24b 对应于宽度为两个字的宽型结构，连续进行“送地址一读出一传送”两次，每次两个 字，其缺失损失为 2x(1+10 +1) =24 个时钟周期；假定宽型结构的宽度为 4 个字，则只要进 行“送地址一读出一传送” 一次，其缺失损失为 1 x(l+10 + 1) =12 个时钟周期。图 6. 24c 对应于交叉存\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the
