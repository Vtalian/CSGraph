的时间 Tm 称为缺失损失 (miss penalty) o\nCPU 在 cache-主存层次的平均访问时间为：\n\nT, = p * Tc  + (1 -P)* (Tm  + TJ) = Tc  + (1 -p) * Ta\n由于程序访问的局部性特点，cache 的命中率可以达到很高，接近于 1。因此，虽然\n缺失损。国内教材对\"不命中”的说法有多种，如\"失效”，••失靶”、•缺失”等，其含义一样，本教材使用“缺失 一词。失 >>命中时间，但最终的平均访问时间仍可接近 cache 的访问时间。\n\n例子：假定处理器时钟周期为 2ns,某程序由 1000 条指令组成，每条指令执行一次，其 中的 4 条指令在取指令时没有在 cache 中找到，其余指令都能在 cache 中取到。在执行指令过 程中，该程序需要 3000 次主存数据访问，其中，6 次没有在 cache 中找到。试问：\n执行该程序得到的 cache 命中率是多少？\n若 cache 中存取一个信息的时间为 1 个时钟周期，缺失损失为 10 个时钟周期，则 CPU 在 cache-\n主存层次的平均访问时间为多少？\n幽①执行该程序时的总访问次数为 1000 + 3000 = 4000,未命中次数为 4+6 = 10,故 cache 命中率为(4000-10)/4000 = 99.75%。\n②平均访问时间为 1 +(1 -99.75%) x 10 = 1. 025 个时钟周期，即 1. 025 x 2ns =2. 05ns, 与cache 访问时间相近。\n\n4.3cache行和主存块的映射\ncache 行中的信息取自主存中的某个块。在将主存块复制到 cache 行时，主存块和 cache 行 之间必须遵循一定的映射规则，这样，CPU 要访问某个主存单元时，可以依据映射规则到 cache 对应的行中査找要访问的信息，而不用在整个 cache 中査找。\n根据不同的映射规则，主存块和 cache 行之间有以下三种映射方式。\n直接(direct)：每个主存块映射到 cache 的固定行中。\n全相联(full associate):每个主存块映射到 cache 的任意行中。\n组相联(set associate)：每个主存块映射到 cache 的固定组的任意行中。以下分别介绍这三种映射方式。\n\n直接映射\n直接映射的基本思想是把主存的每一块映射到固定的一个 cache 行中，也称模映射，其映 射关系如下：\ncache 行号=主存块号 mod cache 行数\n例如，假定 cache 共有 16 行，根据 100 mod 16 =4,可知主存第 100 块应映射到 cache 的第 4 行中。直接映射方式下，主存地址被分成标记、cache 行号和块内地址三个字段。\n\n假定 cache 共有 2。行，主存共有 2m 块，主存块大小占 2“字节，按字节编址，则 cache 行 号占 c位、主存块号占 m 位，块内地址有 b 位。因为 m 位主存块号被分解成标记字段和 cache 行号字段,因而标记字段占 t=m-c 位。\n图 4-4a

a passage from a computer science textbook, discussing cache memory and its characteristics. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n**Cache Memory**\n\nThe text explains that cache memory has two types of access times: cache access time (Tc) and main memory access time (Ta). The average access time (Tav) is a combination of these two, which can be calculated as Tav = p * Tc + (1 - p) * Ta, where p is the probability of accessing data in the cache.\n\n**Cache Hit Rate**\n\nThe text provides an example to illustrate how to calculate the cache hit rate. In this example, a program consists of 1000 instructions, and 4 out of these instructions are not found in the cache when accessed. The remaining 996 instructions are found in the cache. The total number of accesses is 4000 (1000 + 3000), and the number of misses is 10 (4 + 6). Therefore, the cache hit rate is calculated as (4000 - 10) / 4000 = 99.75%.\n\n**Average Access Time**\n\nThe text also calculates the average access time for this example. The average access time is Tav = 1 + (1 - 99.75%) * 10 = 1.025, which is close to the cache access time.\n\n**Cache Mapping**\n\nThe text discusses three types of cache mapping: direct mapping, full associative mapping, and set-associative mapping. Direct mapping maps each main memory block to a fixed cache row, while full associative mapping allows each main memory block to be mapped to any cache row. Set-associative mapping maps each main memory block to a fixed group of cache rows.\n\n**Direct Mapping**\n\nThe text explains that direct mapping is also known as modulo mapping, where the cache row number is calculated as (main memory block number mod cache row number). The text provides an example with 16 cache rows and calculates the mapping for main memory block 100."}]}
