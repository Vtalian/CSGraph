I'll try to summarize your findings and provide some additional insights.\n\n**Dynamic Symbol Table (.dynsym)**\n\nThe `.dynsym` section contains 13 entries, which are symbols that need to be resolved at runtime. The `foo` function is listed as one of these symbols, with an address value of `00000000`. This means that the binary executable file does not have a definition for the `foo` function and needs to resolve it dynamically.\n\n**Relocation Table (.rel.dyn and .rel.plt)**\n\nThe `.rel.dyn` section contains 1 entry, which is a relocation for the `__gmon_start__` symbol. The `.rel.plt` section contains 2 entries, which are relocations for the `__libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.0` and `foo` symbols.\n\n**How the binary executable file resolves foo**\n\nThe binary executable file uses the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) to resolve the `foo` function. The PLT is a table of jump instructions that point to the GOT (Global Offset Table), which contains the actual addresses of the functions.\n\nWhen the binary executable file wants to call the `foo` function, it jumps to the address stored in the GOT entry corresponding to the `foo` symbol. This address is resolved by the dynamic linker (`ld.so`) at runtime.\n\nThe GOT entry for `foo` is located at address `0x804a010`, which contains a pointer to the actual address of the `foo` function in the shared library `lib1.so`. The binary executable file uses this address to call the `foo` function.\n\nIn summary, the binary executable file resolves the `foo` function by:\n\n1. Looking up the `foo` symbol in the dynamic symbol table (.dynsym).\n2. Using the PLT to jump to the GOT entry corresponding to the `foo` symbol.\n3. Resolving the GOT entry at runtime using the dynamic linker (`ld.so`) to get the actual address of the `foo` function in the shared library `lib1.so`.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any further questions."}]}
