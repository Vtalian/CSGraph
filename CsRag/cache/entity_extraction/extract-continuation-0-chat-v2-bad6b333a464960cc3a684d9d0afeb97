In this case, we break at line 16.\n\n## Step 3: Running the program\nWe use the `run` command to start running the program from the beginning.\n\n## Step 4: Stepping through the program\nWe use the `next` command to step through the program one statement at a time. We can also use the `continue` command to continue running the program until it reaches another breakpoint or finishes executing.\n\n## Step 5: Examining variables and expressions\nWe use the `print` command to examine the value of variables or expressions in the program.\n\n## Step 6: Viewing function call stack\nWe use the `backtrace` (or `bt`) command to view the current function call stack.\n\n## Step 7: Exiting functions\nWe use the `finish` command to exit a function and continue running the program until it reaches another breakpoint or finishes executing.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer to this problem, as it is an example of using GDB to debug a C program."}]}
