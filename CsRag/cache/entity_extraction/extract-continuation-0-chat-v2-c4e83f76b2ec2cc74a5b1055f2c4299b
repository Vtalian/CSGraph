However, I must point out that there are multiple questions and tasks in this problem, so I'll do my best to break it down step by step.\n\n**Task 1: Compile program, disassemble program, and take a screenshot**\n\nThis task is not specific to any particular programming language or concept, so I won't provide a detailed answer. However, if you're using a Linux-based system, you can use the following commands to compile and disassemble a C program:\n\n```bash\ngcc -o program program.c\nobjdump -d program > program.disassembly\n```\n\nYou can then take a screenshot of the resulting disassembly code.\n\n**Task 2: Find differences in swap1 and swap2 functions**\n\nThe `swap1` and `swap2` functions are not provided, so I'll assume they're two different implementations of a simple swap function. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```c\nvoid swap1(int *a, int *b) {\n    int temp = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = temp;\n}\n\nvoid swap2(int *a, int *b) {\n    int temp = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = *a; // Note the difference here\n}\n```\n\nThe main difference between `swap1` and `swap2` is that `swap2` uses a temporary variable to store the value of `*a`, whereas `swap1` directly assigns the value of `*b` to `*a`.\n\n**Task 3: Debug program, fill in table**\n\nThis task requires you to debug a C program using a debugger like GDB. I'll assume you're familiar with how to use GDB.\n\nHere's an example table that might be filled out:\n\n| Variable | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `n` | 5 |\n| `result` | ? |\n\nYou can fill in the values for each variable as you debug the program using GDB.\n\n**Task 4: Observe stack frames, recursive calls**\n\nThis task requires you to use a debugger like GDB to observe the stack frames and recursive calls of a C program. Here's an example:\n\n```c\nint nn_sum(int n) {\n    if (n <= 0)\n        return 0;\n    else\n        return n + nn_sum(n - 1);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", nn_sum(5));\n}\n```\n\nYou can use GDB to step through the program and observe the stack frames and recursive calls.\n\n**Task 5: Find system error, calculate stack space**\n\nThis task requires you to debug a C program using a debugger like GDB. I'll assume you're familiar with how to use GDB.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```c\nint nn_sum(int n) {\n    if (n <= 0)\n        return 0;\n    else\n        return n + nn_sum(n - 1);\n}\n\nvoid main() {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", nn_sum(131072));\n}\n```\n\nYou can use GDB to step through the program and observe the stack frames and recursive calls. The system will eventually crash due to a stack overflow.\n\n**Task 6: Fill in table, draw stack frame diagram**\n\nThis task requires you to fill out a table with values for each variable as you debug the program using GDB. You can also draw a diagram of the stack frames at each level of recursion.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n| Variable | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `n` | 3 |\n| `result` | ? |\n\nYou can fill in the values for each variable as you debug the program using GDB.\n\n**Task 7: Find system error, calculate stack space**\n\nThis task is similar to Task 5. You can use GDB to step through the program and observe the stack frames and recursive calls. The system will eventually crash due to a stack overflow.\n\nYou can also calculate the maximum stack space used by the program using the following formula:\n\n`max_stack_space = n * sizeof(int)`\n\nwhere `n` is the input value passed to the `nn_sum` function.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}]}
