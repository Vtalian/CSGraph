For problem 8-2, the output will show the addresses of the members of the struct `x` and `y`.\n\n2. For problem 8-3, the function `exchange` will swap the values of two structs.\n\n3. For problem 4.6.4, if the machine is big-endian, the value of `num.b` will be `0x12`. Otherwise, it will be `0x21`.\n\n4.
