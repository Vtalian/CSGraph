有效数字\n或发生溢出。\n·是，浮点数取负就是简单地将数符取反。\n·不是，例如，当 d = 1.79xl0308、y=l. 0 时，左边为 0(因为 d+f 时/f 需向 d 对阶，对阶后 f 的\n尾数有效数位被舍去而变为 0,故 d+f 仍然等于 d,再减去 d 后结果为 0),而右边 为 1。\n\n4.3 按位运算和逻辑运算\nC 语言中的按位运算有：符号“丨”表示按位“OR”运算；符号\"&”表示按位“AND” 运算；符号表示按位“NOT 运算；符号\"“表示按位“XOR”运算。按位运算的一 个重要运用就是实现掩码(masking) 操作，通过与给定的一个位模式进行按位与，可以提取 所需要的位，然后可以对这些位进行“置 1”、“清\n0”、“是否为 1 测试”或“是否为 0 测试” 等，这里位模式被称为“掩码'。例如，表达式“OxOF&Ox8C” 的运算结果为“00001100”，即 “OxOC”。这里通过掩码“OxOF”提取了一个字节“0x8C”的低 4 位。\nC 语言中的逻辑运算符有：符号\" || ”表示“OR”运算；符号\"&&”表示“AND”运 算；符号“！” 表示“NOT”运算。\n逻辑运算很容易和按位运算混淆，事实上它们的功能完全不同。逻辑运算是非数值计算， 其操作数只有两个逻辑值：“True”和“False”，通常用非 0 数表示逻辑值 True,而全 0 表示逻 辑值 False；而按位运算是一种数值运算，运算时将两个操作数中对应各二进位按照指定的逻辑 运算规则逐位进行计算。例如，若 x = FAH, y=7BH,则叼= 81H, ~ (xy) =7EH,而！(x-y)= 00Ho 也即等价于表达式“x==y”的是\n“!(x”y 也,而不是“~(x”y)”。\n\n4.4 左移运算和右移运算\nC 语言中提供了一组移位运算。移位操作有逻辑移位和算术移位两种。\n逻辑移位不考虑符号位的问题，左移时，高位移出，低位补 0；右移时，低位移岀，高位 补 0。对于无符号整数的逻辑左移，如果最高位移出的是 1,则发生溢出。\n因为计算机内部的带符号整数都是用补码表示的，所以对于带符号整数的移位操作应采用 补码算术移位方式。左移时，高位移出，低位补 0,如果移出的高位不同于移位后的符号位， 也即，若左移前、后符号位不同，则发生“溢出”；右移时，低位移出，高位补符号。\n虽然 C 语言没有明确规定应该釆用逻辑移位还是算术移位，但是，实际上许多机器和编译 器都对无符号整数采用逻辑移位方式，而对带符号整数釆用算术移位方式。因此，编译器只要 根据移位操作数类型就可选择是逻辑还是算术移位。表达式“X<<k”表示对数 X 左移人位。 事实上，对于左移来说，逻辑移位和算术移位的结果都一样，都是丢弃 k 个最高位，并在低位 补 k 个 0。表达式“x>>k”表示对数 x 右移 L 位。\n每左移一位，相当于数值扩大一倍，所以左移可能会发生溢出，左移&位，相当于数值乘 以 2'；每\n右移一位，相当于数值缩小一半\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like you've provided a passage about C programming language, specifically discussing various operators and their behaviors. I'll summarize the key points for you:\n\n1. **Overflow**: When performing arithmetic operations on integers, overflow can occur if the result exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.\n2. **Floating-point numbers**: In C, floating-point numbers are represented in binary format using a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa. The sign bit is simply inverted when taking the negative of a number.\n3. **Bitwise operators**: C provides bitwise operators for performing operations on individual bits of an integer. These include `|` (OR), `&` (AND), `~` (NOT), and `^` (XOR).\n4. **Logical operators**: C also provides logical operators for performing operations on boolean values, which can be represented as 0 or 1 in C. These include `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), and `!` (NOT).\n5. **Left shift and right shift operators**: C provides left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators for shifting the bits of an integer to the left or right, respectively. The behavior of these operators depends on whether they are applied to signed or unsigned integers.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points!"}]}
