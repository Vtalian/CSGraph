的浮点处理架构有两种：较早的一种是与 x86 配套的浮点协处理器 x87 架构，采用 栈结构； 另一种是由 MMX 发展而来的 SSE 指令集架构，采用的是单指令多数据(Single Instruction Multi Data,SIMD)技术，包括 SSE、SSE2、SSE3、SSSE3、SSE4 等。对于 IA-32 架构， GCC 默认生成 x87 指令集代码，如果想要生成 SEE 指令集代码，则需要设置适当的编译选项。\nx87 FPU 有一个浮点寄存器栈，栈的深度为 8,每个浮点寄存器有 80 位。根据指令的操作 功能，x87 浮点数指令可分为浮点数装入、浮点数存储、整数浮点数转换、浮点数算术运算和 浮点数测试比较等几种类型。\n浮点数装入指令用来将存储单元或原栈中的浮点数装入到浮点寄存器栈的栈顶 ST(0)。由 于浮点寄存器宽度为 80 位，所以，这些指令中指定的从存储单元中取出的浮点数不管是 32 位 还是 64 位，都要先转换为 80 位扩展精度格式后再装入栈顶。浮点数存储指令用来将浮点寄存器栈的栈顶 ST(0)中的元素存储到存储单元中。由于浮 点寄存器宽度为 80 位，所以，需要先将 80 位扩展精度格式转换为 32 位或 64 位格式后再存储 到指定存储单元中。由于 x87 中浮点寄存器为 80 位，而在内存中的浮点数可能占 32 位、64 位或 96 位，因而 在内存单元和浮点数寄存器之间进行数据传送的过程中，可能会丢失精度而造成错误计算结 果，需要引起注意。图 1-9 所示是两个功能完全相同的程序，但是，使用 gcc 的一些旧版本对它们进行编译时， 会发生以下情况：使用 gcc-O2 编译程序一时，运行后输出结果是 0,也就是说。不等于使 用 gcc-02 编译程序二时，运行后输出结果却是 1,也就是说 a 等于 6。两个几乎一模一样的程 序，但运行结果不一致。\n\n图 2-4 浮点运算示例\n出现上述情况的主要原因是存储单元和浮点数寄存器之间进行数据传送的过程中丢失了 精度。gcc 对于程序一的处理过程如下：先计算 a=f(10),然后将其写到存储单元，由于 0. 1 = 0. 0 0011[0011]B,即转换为二进制数时是无限循环小数，因此无法用有限位数的二进制精确 表示。在将其从 80 位的浮点寄存器写入到 64 位(double 类型占 64 位)的存储区域时，产生 了精度损失。然后，计算 6=f(10), 这个结果并没被写入存储器中，这样，在计算关系表达式 “a==b”时，直接将损失了精度的 a 与栈顶中的 6 进\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the provided text is not related to Durke Bataglani or Firuzabad, but rather a technical document about computer
