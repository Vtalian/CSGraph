outputs 的栈帧状态。\n\n图 5-1  outputs 栈帧中的内容\n图 5-1 中传递给 strcpy 的实参 M [ R[ ebp] + 8 ] 实际上就是在 main 函数中指定的命令行参数首地址，它是一个字符串的首址，此程序中函数 strcpy 实现的功能就是，将命令行中指定的字符串复制到缓冲区buffer 中，如果攻击者在命令行中构造一个长度为16+4+4+ 1 =25 个字符的字符串，并将 hacker 函数的首地址置于结束符'\\0'前面的 4 个字节，则在执行完 strcpy 函数后 hacker 代码段首地址被置于过程main 栈帧最后的返回地址处，当执行到 outputs 代码的第 14 行 ret 指令时，便会转到 hacker 函数实施攻击。这里，25个字符中的前16个字符填满buffer区，4 个字符覆盖掉 EBP 的旧值，4 个字节的 hacker 函数首地址覆盖返回地址，还有一个是字符串结束符。\n·假定 hacker 代码首地址为 0x08048411,则可编写如下的攻击代码实施攻击。\n\n#include \"stdio.h\" 2\nchar code[]-\n3 \"0123456789ABCDEFXXXX\"\n4    ,,\\xll\\x84\\x04\\x08n\n5    M\\x00\";\n6 int

test。因此，字符串中前 16 个字符’0'、’1'、'2，、’3，、 '5'、'6'、'7'、\n'8'、‘9‘、'A'、'B'、'C'、'D'、'E'、'F'被复制到 buffer 中，4 个字符'X'覆盖掉 EBP 的旧值，地址 0x08048411 覆盖掉返回地址。执行上述攻击程序后的输岀结果为：\n ••0123456789ABCDEFXXXX □□□□\nbeing hacked Segmentation fault\n输岀结果中第一行为执行。utputs 函数后的结果，其中后面 4 个为不可显示字符(对应 ASCII 码 11H、84H、xO4H 和 08H)；执行完 outputs 后程序被恶意地跳转到 hacker 函数执行, 因此会显示第二行字符串； 最后一行显示“Segmentation fault (段错误)”，其原因是在调用 hacker 函数时并没有保存其调用函数的返回地址，所以在执行到 hacker 过程的 ret 指令时取到 的“返回地址”是一个不确定的值，因而可能跳转到数据区或系统区或其他非法访问的存储 区去执行，造成段错误。\n   上面的错误主要是 strcpy()函数没有进行缓冲区边界检查而直接把 str 中的内容复制到 buffer 造成的。存在像 strcpy 这样问题的标准函数还有 s treat。、sprintf。、vsprintf。、gets。、 scanf() 等。\n缓冲区溢出攻击有多种英文名称：buffer overflow, buffer overrun, smash the stack, trash the stack, scribble the stack, mangle the stack, memory leak, overrun screw 等。第一个缓冲区溢出攻 击是 Morris 蠕虫，发生在 20 年前，它曾造成全世界 6000 多台网络服务器瘫痪。\n随便往缓冲区中填东西造成它溢出一般只会出现段错误，而不能达到攻击的目的。最常见 的手段是通过制造缓冲区溢出使程序运行一个用户 shell,再通过 shell 执行其他命令。如果该 程序属于 root 且有 suid 权限的话，攻击者就获得了一个有 root 权限的 shell,就可以对系统进行 任意操作了。\n缓冲区溢出攻击之所以成为一种常见安全攻击手段，其原因在于缓冲区溢出漏�\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that you've provided a text about a buffer overflow attack in C programming. I'll summarize the key points:\n\n**Buffer Overflow Attack**\n\n* The attack exploits a vulnerability in the `strcpy` function, which doesn't perform boundary checking.\n* An attacker can craft a string with a specific length to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address on the stack.\n* In this case, the hacker's code is placed at the overwritten return address, allowing it to be executed when the program returns from the `outputs` function.\n\n**Attack Details**\n\n* The attacker crafts a string of 25 characters: 16 characters fill the buffer, 4 characters overwrite the old value of EBP (base pointer), and 4 bytes contain the hacker's code address.\n* The hacker's code address is placed at the overwritten return address, allowing it to be executed when the program returns from the `outputs` function.\n\n**Output**\n\n* The output shows the first line as the result of executing the `outputs` function, followed by a segmentation fault error message.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Buffer overflow attacks are a common security threat due to their ease of exploitation.\n* This attack demonstrates how an attacker can gain control of a program's execution flow and potentially execute malicious code with elevated privileges."}]}
