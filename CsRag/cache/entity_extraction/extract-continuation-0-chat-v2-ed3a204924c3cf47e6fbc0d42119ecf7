1 < 256; 1++)\n\nfor (j = 0; j < 256; j++) sum += a[1][j]；\n程序 B：\n1nt a[256][256];\n\n\n1nt sum_array2()\n{\n\nint 1, J, sum = 0\nfor ( J = 0; j <256； J++)\nfor ( 1 = 0; 1 < 256; 1++) sum += a[1 Hj];\nreturn sum；\n\n图4-11 伪代码程序\n假定 int 类型数据用 32 位补码表示，程序编译时 i、j、sum 均分配在寄存器中，数组 a 按行 优先方式存放，其首地址为 320（十进制数）。请回答下列问题，要求说明理由或给出计算过程。\n若不考虑用于 cache —致性维护和替换算法的控制位，则数据 cache 的总容量为多少？\n数组元素。[0][31]和 a[l][l]各自所在主存块对应的 cache 行号分别是多少（行号 从 0 开始）？\n程序 A 和 B 的数据访问命中率各是多少？哪个程序的执行时间更短？\n①cache 中的每一行信息除了用于存放主存块的数据区外，还有有效位、标记信息以 及用于 cache — 致性维护的修改位（dirty bit）和用于替换算法的使用位（如 LRU 位）等控制 位。因为主存地址空间大小为 256MB,因而主存地址为 28 位，其中 6 位为块内地址，3 位为 cache 行号（行索引），标志信息有28-6-3=19 位。因此，在不考虑用于 cache -致性维护和 替换算法的控制位的情况下，数据 cache 的总容量为 8 x（19+ 1 +64 x8） =4256 位=532 字节。\n对于某个数组元素所在主存块对应的 cache 行号的计算方法有以下三种。\n方法一：要得到某个数组元素所在块对应的 cache 行号，最简单的做法就是把该数组元素 的地址计算出来，然后根据地址求出主存块号，最后用主存块号除以 8 取余数（即主存块号 mod 8）就是对应的\ncache 行号。因为每个数组元素为一个 32 位 int 型变量，故占 4 个字节。因 此，a[0][31]的地址为 320+ 4 x 31 =444, [444/64] =6 （取整），也即 a[0][31]对应的主 存块号为 6。因为\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can help you with the problem. However, I need to point out that the format you requested is not suitable for this type of question, as it requires a numerical answer and explanations.\n\nHere's my attempt to provide the solution in the requested format:\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the data cache\nThe total capacity of the data cache can be calculated by multiplying the number of cache rows (8) by the size of each cache row (19 + 1 + 64 x 8). This gives us a total capacity of 4256 bits, which is equivalent to 532 bytes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the cache row number for array element a[0][31]\nTo find the cache row number for array element a[0][31], we need to calculate its address and then divide it by 64 (the block size) to get the block number. The address of a[0][31] is 320 + 4 x 31 = 444, which divided by 64 gives us 6. Therefore, the cache row number for a[0][31] is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the cache row number for array element a[i][i]\nSimilarly, to find the cache row number for array element a[i][i], we need to calculate its address and then divide it by 64 (the block size) to get the block number. The address of a[i][i] is 320 + 4 x (256 i + i) = 320 + 1024 i, which divided by 64 gives us 16 i. Therefore, the cache row number for a[i][i] is 16 i.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the data access hit rate for program A\nTo calculate the data access hit rate for program A, we need to consider that each iteration of the outer loop accesses 256 elements in the same cache row (since the inner loop iterates over all elements in a single cache row). Therefore, the data access hit rate for program A is 100%.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the data access hit rate for program B\nSimilarly, to calculate the data access hit rate for program B, we need to consider that each iteration of the outer loop accesses 256 elements in different cache rows (since the inner loop iterates over all elements in a single cache row). Therefore, the data access hit rate for program B is 0%.\n\n## Step 6: Compare the execution times of programs A and B\nSince program A has a higher data access hit rate than program B, its execution time will be shorter.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{532}$"}]}
