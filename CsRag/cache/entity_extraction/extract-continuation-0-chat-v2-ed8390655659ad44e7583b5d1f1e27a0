我们自己去编写，而是在编译连接时由链接器将编译器中事先准备好的引导代码和我们的应用程序一起构成最终的可执行程序；\n(2).加载器是操作系统中的程序。当执行一个程序时(譬如./a.out，譬如代码中用exec函数来运行)，加载器负责将这个程序加载到内存中去执行这个程序；\n(3).程序的退出：可以有正常终止和非正常终止两种方式。程序中可以调用return、exit、_exit等指令正常终止，也可以自己或他人发信号(例如Ctrl+C就是一个信号)非正常终止进程。通过atexit函数来注册进程终止处理函数。退出前执行此终止处理程序；当atexit注册有多个进程终止处理函数，先注册的终止处理函数后执行；\n(5).ubuntu中执行export命令来查看进程环境变量；\n(6).每一个进程中都有一份所有环境变量构成的一个表格，进程中可以直接使用这些环境变量。进程环境表其实是一个字符串数组，用environ变量指向它。\n1.4.2 多进程调度原理\n操作系统中可以同时运行多个进程。宏观上多进程是一种并行的方式，在微观上需要在多个进程之间切换。调度器在多个进程之间进行切换。操作系统的调度器其实就是一个算法，用来决定先运行谁，后运行谁，谁运行多长时间。实际上现代操作系统最小的调度单元是线程而不是进程。\n操作系统给每一个进程一个ID号来标识这个进程。我们可以通过ps命令在ubuntu中查看当前运行的进程信息，其中PID即为进程的ID号。最开始的是进程0和进程1。进程0为内核态，进程1为内核态过度到用户态的一个重要进程。所有的进程都源于进程1。\n1.4.3 进程的创建\n操作系统中构建一个全新的进程是非常复杂的事情。为了简化这个过程，采用分裂生长模式构建新的进程。操作系统会复制一个现有的进程生成一个新进程。老进程叫父进程，复制生成的新进程叫子进程。创建完成之后的父子进程会同时运行。新生成的子进程继承了一些父进程的属性，但是有着自己独立的PCB，同时也能被内核进行同等调度。\n1.4.5 进程的5种状态\n(1).就绪态：所有运行条件均就绪，只要得到了CPU时间就能直接运行；\n(2).运行态：就绪态时得到了CPU就进入运行态开始运行；\n(3).僵尸态：进程已经结束但是父进程还没来得及回收；\n(4).等待态（浅度睡眠&深度睡眠）：进程在等待某种条件，条件成熟后可进入就绪态。等待态下就算你给他CPU调度进程也无法执行。浅度睡眠等待时进程可以被（信号）唤醒，而深度睡眠等待时不能被唤醒只能等待的条件到了才能结束睡眠状态；\n(5).暂停态：暂停并不是进程的终止，只是被被人（信号）暂停了，还可以恢复的。\n1.4.6 进程间的关系\n(1).无关系：两个进程之间是完全独立的。无关的进程之间不能随便访问。\n(2).父子进程：父进程继承给子进程的东西都是fork之前的。子进程变为僵尸进程后，需要父进程对它进行回收。\n(3).进程组（group）：由若干进程构成一个进程组。也就是属主所在的组，他们的进程组ID相同，放在一个组的目的是为了方便管理这些进程。组内进程的关系比组外的更有联系。\n(4).会话（session）：会话就是进程组的组。由若干进\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the text is a passage about operating systems, specifically about processes and process management. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n**Real Data**\n\nThe passage discusses various aspects of process management in an operating system.\n\n**Entity types**\n\nThe entity types mentioned are:\n\n1. Organization\n2. Person\n3. Geo (Geographic location)\n4. Event\n\nHowever, these entity types seem unrelated to the main topic of the passage, which is about processes and process management.\n\n**Text**\n\nThe text discusses various topics related to processes and process management, including:\n\n1. Program loading and execution\n2. Process termination (normal and abnormal)\n3. Viewing environment variables in Ubuntu using the `export` command\n4. Process scheduling principles\n5. Creating a new process by duplicating an existing one (forking)\n6. The five states of a process: just ready, running, zombie, waiting, and paused\n\n**Key points**\n\nSome key points from the passage include:\n\n* A program is loaded into memory by the loader when it's executed.\n* Processes can terminate normally or abnormally.\n* Environment variables are stored in a table that can be accessed by each process.\n* The operating system uses a scheduler to decide which process to run next.\n* A new process can be created by duplicating an existing one using the `fork` function.\n* A process can be in one of five states: just ready, running, zombie, waiting, or paused.\n\nOverall, the passage provides a detailed explanation of various aspects of process management in an operating system."}]}
