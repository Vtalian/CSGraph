unix >\nshell 命令行解释器会显示提示符 unix > ,告知用户它准备接收用户的输入，此时，用户可 以在提示符后面输入需要执行的命令名，它可以是一个可执行文件在磁盘上的路径名，例如， 上述“./hello” 就是可执行文件 hello 的路径名，其中表示当前目录。在命令后用户需按 下［Enter］键表示结束。图1.8显示了在计算机中执行的整个过程。\n\n图 1.8 启动和执行 hell。程序的整个过程\n如图 1.8 所示，shell 程序会将用户从键盘输入的每个字符逐一读入 CPU 寄存器中（对应 线①）， 然后再保存到主存储器中，在主存的缓冲区形成字符串\"./hell。\"（对应线②）。等到接 收到［Enter］ 按键时，shell 将调出操作系统内核中相应的服务例程，由内核来加载磁盘上的 可执行文件 hello 到存储器（对应线③）。内核加载完可执行文件中的代码及其所要处理的数据 （这里是字符串\"hello, world\n\\n\"）后，将 hello 第一条指令的地址送到程序计数器（Program Counter,简称 PC）中，CPU 永远都是将\nPC 的内容作为将要执行的指令的地址，因此，处理器 随后开始执行 hello 程序，它将加载到主存的字符串\"heUo, world\\n\"中的每一个字符从主存取 到 CPU 的寄存器中（对应线④），然后将 CPU 寄存器中的字符送到显示器上显示出来（对应 线⑤）。\n从上述过程可以看出，一个用户程序被启动执行，必须依靠操作系统的支持，包括外壳程 序和内核服务例程。例如，shell 命令行解释器是操作系统外壳程序，它为用户提供了一个启动 程序执行的环境， 对用户从键盘输入的命令进行解释，并调出操作系统内核来加载用户程序 （用户输入命令对应的程序）。显然，用来加载用户程序并使其从第一条指令开始执行的操作 系统内核服务例程也是必不可少的。此外， 在上述过程中，涉及键盘、磁盘和显示器等外部设 备的操作，这些底层硬件是不能由用户程序直接访问的，此时，也需要依靠操作系统内核服务 例程的支持，例如，用户程序需要调用内核的 read 系统调用服务例程读取磁盘文件，或调用内 核的 write 系统调用服务例程把字符串写到显示器中等。\n从图 1.8 可以看出，程序的执行过程就是数据在 CPU、主存储器和 I/O 模块之间流动的过程， 所\n有数据的流动都是通过总线、I/O 桥接器等进行的。数据在总线上传输之前，需要先缓存在存 储部件中，因此，除了主存储器本身是存储部件以外，在 CPU、I/O 桥接器、设备控制器中也有 存放数据的缓冲存储部件，例如，CPU 中的寄存器堆、设备控制器中的数据缓冲寄存器等。\n\n1.3.5 程序中每条指令的执行\n每个可执行目标文件中都包含机器代码段，可执行文件的执行实际上是对应的机器代码段执行的过程。机器代码段由一条一条机器指令构成 c 指会(instruction)是用 0 和 1 表示的一串 0/1 序列， 用来指示 CPU 完成一个特定的原子操作，例如，取数指令(load instruction)从存储 单元中取出一个数据存放到 CPU 寄存器中，存数指令(store instruction)将 CPU 寄存器的内容 写入一个存储单元，ALU 指令(ALU instruction)将两个寄存器内容进行某种算术或逻辑运算 后再送入一个 CPU 寄存器中，输出指令(output
