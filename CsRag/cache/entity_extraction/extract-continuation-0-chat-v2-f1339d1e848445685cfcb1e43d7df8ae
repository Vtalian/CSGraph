指令集将目标编译成 x86-64 代码。通常，在 IA-32 架构上运 行的是 32 位操作系统，GCC 默认生成 IA-32 代码；在 x86-M 架构上运行的是 64 位操作系统，GCC 默认生成 x86-M 代码。Linux 和 GCC 将前者称为*i386\"平台，将后者称为“x86-64”平台。\n与 IA-32 代码相比，x86-64 代码主要有以下几个方面的特点。\nIA-32 具有更多的通用寄存器个数。新增的 8 个 64 位通用寄存器名称分别为 R8、R9、 RIO、Rll、R12、R13、R14 和 R15。它们可以作为 8 位寄存器（R8B~R15B）、16 位寄存器 （R8W-R15W）或 32位寄存器（R8D-R15D）使用，以访问其中的低 8 位、低 16 位或低 32 位。\nIA-32 具有更长的通用寄存器位数，从 32 位扩展到 64 位。在 x86-64 中，所有通用寄 存器（GPR）都从 32 位扩充到了 64 位，名称也发生了变化。8 个 32 位通用寄存器 EAX、EBX、ECX、EDX、EBP、ESP、ESI 和 EDI 对应的扩展为 64 位的寄存器分别被命名为 RAX、RBX、RCX、RDX、RBP、RSP、RSI 和 RDI。在 IA-32 中，四个寄存器 EBP、ESP、ESI 和 EDI 的低 8 位不能使用，而在 x86-64 架构中， 可以使用这些寄存器的低 8 位，其对应的寄存器名称为 BPL、SPL、SIL 和 DIL。\n整数操作不仅支持 8、16、32 位数据类型，还支持 64 位数据类型。所有算术逻辑运算、 寄存器与内存之间的数据传输，都能以最多 64 位为单位进行操作。栈的压入和弹出操作都以 8 字节为单位进行。\n字长从 32 位变为 64 位，因而逻辑地址从 32 位变为 64 位。指针（如 char,型）和长整 型（long 型）数据从 32 位扩展到 64 位，与 IA-32 平台相比，理论上其数据访问的空间大小从 2%=4GB 扩展到了 2\"B= 16EB。不过，目前仅支持 48 位逻辑地址空间，即逻辑地址从 4GB 增加到了 256TB。\n对于 long double 型数据，虽然还是采用与 IA-32 相同的 80 位扩展精度格式，但是，所 分配的存储空间从 IA-32 的 12 字节扩展为 16 字节。也即，此类数据的边界从 12B 对齐改为 16B 对齐，不管是分配 12 字节还是分配 16 字节，都只会用到低 10 个字节。\n过程调用时，对于入口参数只有 6 个以内的整型变量和指针型变量的情况，通常就用 通用寄存器而不是栈来传递，因而，很多过程可以不用访问栈，这样，使得大多数情况下执行 时间比 IA-32 代码更短。\n128 位的 MMX 寄存器从原来的 8 个增加到了 16 个，浮点操作采用基于 SSE 的面向 XMM 寄存器的指令集，而不采用基于浮点寄存器栈的指令集。\n\n6.2 X86-64的寄存器组织\n\n\n6.3 x86-64的基本指令和对齐\nx86-64 指令集在兼容 1A-32 的基础上，还能支持 64 位数据操作指令，大部分操作数指示 符与
