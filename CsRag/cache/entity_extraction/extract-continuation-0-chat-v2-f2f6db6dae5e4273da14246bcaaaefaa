The `R_386_RELATIVE` type indicates that the relocation is relative to the base address of the shared object.\n\n**Task (2)**\n\nYou've provided a snippet of the `objdump` output for `lib1.so`. The `.got.plt` section contains 5 entries:\n\nOffset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name\n0000200c  00000907 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000550   bar\n00002010  00000507 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   ext\n\nThe `.got.plt` section contains the Global Offset Table (GOT) for Procedure Linkage Tables (PLTs). The `R_386_JUMP_SLOT` type indicates that the relocation is a jump to a symbol in the GOT.\n\n**Task (3)**\n\nYou've asked me to explain how the GOT and PLT work together. In short, the GOT contains the addresses of symbols in the shared object, while the PLT contains the code for resolving those symbols. When a program accesses a symbol through the PLT, it first checks the GOT to see if the address is already cached. If not, it resolves the symbol and caches its address in the GOT.\n\n**Task (4)**\n\nYou've asked me to explain how the `.rel.plt` section works. The `.rel.plt` section contains relocations for the PLT. Each entry in the section corresponds to a jump instruction in the PLT that needs to be resolved. The `R_386_JUMP_SLOT` type indicates that the relocation is a jump to a symbol in the GOT.\n\n**Task (5)**\n\nYou've asked me to explain how the `.got.plt` section works. As I mentioned earlier, the `.got.plt` section contains the Global Offset Table (GOT) for Procedure Linkage Tables (PLTs). Each entry in the section corresponds to a symbol that is accessed through the PLT.\n\n**Task (6)**\n\nYou've asked me to explain how the program headers work. The program headers are used by the dynamic linker to load and map the shared object into memory. There are several types of program headers, including:\n\n* `LOAD`: loads a segment of the shared object into memory\n* `DYNAMIC`: contains information about the dynamic linker\n* `NOTE`: contains notes for the dynamic linker\n\n**Task (7)**\n\nYou've asked me to explain how the GOT and PLT sections work together. As I mentioned earlier, the GOT contains the addresses of symbols in the shared object, while the PLT contains the code for resolving those symbols.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}]}
