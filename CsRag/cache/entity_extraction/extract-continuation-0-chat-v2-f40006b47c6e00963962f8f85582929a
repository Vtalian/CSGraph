个晶体管）到 20 世纪末的千万 个晶体管/片。以最大的微处理器制造商 Intel 产品为例（见表 1.1）可以看出，半导体集成电路 的集成度越来越高，速度也越来越快， 其发展遵循以下摩尔定律:由于硅技术的不断改进，每 18 个月，集成度将翻一番，速度将提高一倍，而其价格将降低一半。戈登•摩尔（Golden Moore） 是 Intel 公司的创始人之一，摩尔定律是 1965 年美国《电子》杂志的总编在釆访摩尔先生时他对 半导体芯片工业发展前景的预测，40 多年来的实践证明，摩尔定律的预测是基本准确的。\n表 1.1 Intel CPU 芯片性能比较\n\n随着超大规模集成电路与微处理器技术的长足进步和现代科学技术对提高计算能力的强烈 需求，并行处理技术的研究与应用以及众多巨型机的产生也成为这一时期计算机发展的特点。 1976 年，Cray 公司推出的 Cray-1 向量巨型机，具有 12 个功能部件，运算速度达每秒 1. 6 亿次 浮点运算。不少巨型机采用成百上千个高性能处理器组成大规模并行处理系统，其峰值速度已 达到每秒几千亿或万亿次，这种并行处理技术成为 20 世纪 90 年代巨型机发展的主流。\n第四代计算机时期的另一个重要特点是计算机网络的发展与广泛应用。由于计算机技术与 通信技术的高速发展与密切结合，掀起了网络热潮，大量的计算机联入不同规模的网络中，然 后通过 Internet 与世界各地的计算机相联，大大扩展和加速了信息的流通，增强了社会的协调 与合作能力，使计算机的应用方式也由个人计算方式向网络化方向发展。\n由于计算机在技术发展和使用方式上的不断进步，目前学术界和工业界大多已不再沿用传统以元器件划分“第 x 代计算机”的提法。\n近 70 年来，人们使用计算机的方式发生了巨大变化。早先是多人共享一台计算机(分时 计算方式)， 然后是一人使用一台计算机(个人计算方式)，进而发展到目前多人使用多台计 算机的网络计算方式，也就是后 PC 时代。进一步的发展趋势是人们将进入普适计算(pervasive computing)时代。\n计算机技术的另一个重要发展方向是计算机的智能化，其着眼点是发展以知识为基础的智 能化处理能力，用以模拟或部分替代人的智能活动，并提供智能化的人机交互接口，使计算机具 有自然的人机通信能力。普适化、智能化、嵌入式和网络化将是未来计算机发展的主要方向。\n\n1.1.6
