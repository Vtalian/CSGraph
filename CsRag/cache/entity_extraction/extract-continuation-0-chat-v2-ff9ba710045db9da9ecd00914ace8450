中取出来执行的。存储器是计算机系统中的重要组成部分，相当于计算机的“仓库”，用来存 放各类程序及其处理的数据。计算机中所用的存储元件有多种类型，如触发器构成的寄存器、半导体静态 RAM 和动态 RAM、Flash 存储器、磁盘、磁带和光盘等，它们各自有不同的速度、 容量和价格，各类存储器按照层次化方式构成计算机的存储器整体结构。\n本章主要介绍构成层次化存储结构的几类存储器的工作原理和组织形式。主要包括：半导 体随机存取存储器、只读存储器、Flash 存储器、磁盘存储器等不同类型存储器的特点，存储 器芯片和 CPU 的连接，高速缓存的基本原理以及虚拟存储器系统的实现技术等。\n\n存储器概述\n\n1.1存储器的分类\n根据存储器的特点和使用方法的不同，可以有以下几种分类方法。\n\n1.1.1 按存储元件分类\n存储元件必须具有截然不同且相对稳定的两个物理状态，才能被用来表示二进制代码。和 1。目前使用的存储元件主要有半导体器件、磁性材料和光介质。用半导体器件构成的存储器 称为半导俺存储器;磁性材料存储器主要是磁表面存僅器,如磁盘存储器和磁带存储器；光介 质存储器称为光盘存储器。\n\n按存取方式分类\n随机存取存储器\n.随机存取契储器(Random Access Memory,简称 RAM)的特点是按地址访问存储单元，因 为每个地址译码时间相同，所以，在不考虑芯片内部缓冲的前提下，每个单元的访问时间是一 个常数，与地址无关。不过，现在的 DRAM 芯片内都具有行缓冲，因而有些数据可能因为已在 行缓冲中而缩短了访问时间。随机存取存储器的存储介质是半导体存储器件。\n顺序存取存储器\n顺序存取契储器(Sequential Access Memory,简称 SAM )的特点是信息按顺序存放和读 出，其存取时间取决于信息存放位置，以记录块为单位编址。磁带存储謂就是一种顺序存取存储器，其存储容量大，但存取速度慢。\n（3）直接存取存储器\n\n直接存取存储器(Direct Access Memory,简称 DAM)的存取方式兼有随机访问和顺序访问 的特点。首先直接定位到需读写信息所在区域的开始处，然后按顺序方式存取，磁盘存储器就 是如此。\n相联存储器\n\n上述三类存储器都是按所需信息的地址来访问，但有些情况下可能不知道所访问信息的地 址，只知道要访问信息的内容特征，此时，只能按内容检索到存储位置进行读写。这种存储器 称为按内容访问存储器(Content Addressed Memory,简称 CAM )或相联存储器(Associative Memory,简称 AM) 0 如快表就是一种相联存储器。\n\n\n按信息的可更改性分类\n\n按信息可更改性分读写存储器(Read/Write Memory)和只读存储器(Read Only Memory)。 读写存储器中的信息可以读出和写入，RAM 芯片是一种读写存储器；只读存储器用\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
